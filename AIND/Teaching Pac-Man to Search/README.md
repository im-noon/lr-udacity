What is a Lab?
A lab is an optional self-assessed project where you will implement the techniques discussed in the lesson on a real-world problem.

Overview
In this lab, you will teach Pac-Man to search his world to complete the following tasks:

find a single obstacle.
find multiple obstacles.
find the fastest way to eat all the food in the map.
This lab is possible thanks to the generous contributions of the UC Berkeley AI division and their work on the Pac-Man Project. The below is an example of what your AI will help Pac-Man do by the end of this lab!
