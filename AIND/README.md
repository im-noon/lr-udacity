# Assigment Project for Udacity's Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree


## Project-1: [Diagonal Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/knopthakorn/Udacity-course/tree/master/AIND/AIND-Sudoku)

In this project was implement two extensions Sudoku game.
The first one will be to implement the technique called "naked twins".
The second one will be to modify our existing code to solve a diagonal sudoku.

## Project-2: [Build a Game-playing Agent](https://github.com/knopthakorn/Udacity-course/tree/master/AIND/AIND-Isolation)

In this project show how to develop an adversarial search agent to play the game "Isolation". Isolation is a deterministic, two-player game of perfect information in which the players alternate turns moving a single piece from one cell to another on a board. Whenever either player occupies a cell, that cell becomes blocked for the remainder of the game. The first player with no remaining legal moves loses, and the opponent is declared the winner. These rules are implemented in the isolation.Board class provided in the repository.

Additionally, agents will have a fixed time limit each turn to search for the best move and respond. If the time limit expires during a player's turn, that player forfeits the match, and the opponent wins.

## Project-3: [Implement a Planning Search](https://github.com/knopthakorn/Udacity-course/tree/master/AIND/AIND-Planning)

In this project implement tree extensions.
The first implement domain-independent heuristics of problems in classical PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) for the air cargo domain discussed in the lectures. then set up the problems for search, experiment with various automatically generated heuristics, including planning graph heuristics, to solve the problems.
Ther second analysis the heuristics algorithm.
The final is write a short research review paper on the historical development of planning techniques and their use in artificial intelligence.

## Project-4: [Build a Sign Language Recognizer](https://github.com/knopthakorn/Udacity-course/tree/master/AIND/AIND-Recognizer)

In this project, implement a system that can recognize words communicated using the American Sign Language (ASL).
By provided a preprocessed dataset of tracked hand and nose positions extracted from video. build by using dataset from [RWTH-BOSTON-104 Database](http://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~dreuw/database-rwth-boston-104.php).
the goal is to implement modelsector and feature engineering to train a set of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to identify individual words from test sequences.

## Project-5: [Dog Breed Classifier](https://github.com/knopthakorn/Udacity-course/tree/master/AIND/AIND-Dog-Breed-Classifier)
In this project, you will learn how to build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canine’s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

## Project-6: [Dog Breed Classifier](https://github.com/knopthakorn/Udacity-course/tree/master/AIND/AIND-CV-FacialKeypoints)
In this project, you’ll combine your knowledge of computer vision techniques and deep learning to build and end-to-end facial keypoint recognition system. Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on any face and are used in many applications, from facial tracking to emotion recognition.
