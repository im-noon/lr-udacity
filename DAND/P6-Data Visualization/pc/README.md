This is an example for adding mousehover event to [Parallel Coordinates](https://github.com/syntagmatic/parallel-coordinates). I needed to make small changes to sourcecode. If you want to try this you need to address [this file](http://mostapharoudsari.github.io/Honeybee/pc_source_files/d3/d3.parcoords.js) until Kai [implements it to source code](https://github.com/syntagmatic/parallel-coordinates/issues/32).
